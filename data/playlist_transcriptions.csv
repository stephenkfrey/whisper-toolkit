Deep Learning Maps Animal Movement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaUy6zyJfwU," We developed a new type of 3D deep learning approach that can take in normal color videos of behaving animals and behaving humans and then output the precise 3D locations of body landmarks so skeletal joints that you can track over time and thus provide a comprehensive description of how subjects are moving. This is a huge leap forward compared to a traditional motion capture system in which subjects need to wear highly invasive markers on the body. And then another big issue with motion captures that it requires that you have a clear line of sights to these markers and in a deep learning-based approach that we develop, we relieve this requirement."
First look: Stable Diffusion's Top 10 Datasets,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcKJD7PUaZg," I don't think I've ever done a one minute video before. We're wasting time. Stable diffusions top 10 datasets. I generated this image via stable diffusion, which is available for free online. Stable diffusion is one of the largest text image models in the world. It used four times as many images in training compared to open AR's Dolly 2. Just so reminder that all text image models only look at images during training. They do not store and they cannot reproduce the original images. Number one, Pinterest at 8.6% of stable diffusion's data set. Then WordPress. Find out America the marketplace. Once or three RF, the stock photo site. Shopify smug mug, square space. Daily mail the new site, Wikimedia, photo shelter, and two billion more images. I'd love to have you join me to learn more about these kind of things at the Memor."
